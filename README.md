## Feedback

Designing and building a portfolio from scratch can be tough. To inspire you and provide you a foundation to build upon, I've decided to publish [my personal website](https://konstantin.digital) as a Gatsby Starter. This boilerplate project should motivate you to build your own awesome portfolio with Gatsby.

I always appreciate feedback, so share your thoughts and suggestions with me: [mail@konstantin.digital](mailto:mail@konstantin.digital)

If you find any bugs or have feature suggestions, create a new issue or pull request 🙏

Thanks a lot for using this starter! 💪
