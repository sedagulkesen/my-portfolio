ItchyFeet is an Android application that uses real-time data to give personalized recommendations on places to visit in an optimized route and traveler partners based on the user‚Äôs interests.

It is developed by 4 Computer Science students(including me) as a senior design project in university.

I took the full responsibility of designing and developing the front end of the project using React.
